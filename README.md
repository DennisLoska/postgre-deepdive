# postgre-deepdive

Just tinkering around with postgre trying things out to level up.

Useful `psql` commands:

-   \h to list all commands
-   \c to connect to a database
-   \d `table_name` to show all columns
-   \dt to list all tables
-   \du to list all db users

(Postgre)SQL syntax specific commands:

-   `ANALYZE VERBOSE my_table` analyzes the table's rows
-   `EXPLAIN MY_QUERY` explains the query

Always use a semicolon `;` to end a command or bad things will happen!
